# Squirrel_3D

## Intro
This is a repo for 3D data visualization of 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census. 

Find the data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw

All the visualization is made out of the dataset above in Blender. To run the script and generate the visualization, make sure to download Blender (https://www.blender.org/) first.

## How to run scripts in Blender
1. In ".blend" file, open "Scripting" workspace. 
2. Use the "browser text to be linked" button to switch between scripts.
- if you could not find any script file open in Blender, Select "Text" >>> "Open", open the files file from "Scripts" folder with corresponding names.
3. Run it with "run script" button (little triangle). The button will run the current script only.

4. Console output

- For Windows user: Editor Type >>> Python Console

- For MacOS user: few extra steps ðŸ™„ to follow from this tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbQCzk-ef3g

- I'm not sure about other operating systems

Before run "Scatter_Black", "Scatter_Cinnamon", and "Scatter_Gray", **be sure to create a sphere object with corresponding material in the viewport and select that object.** This is to take advantage of linked objects that save spaces, so that you won't find a 400 MB file when exportingðŸ˜¢.
