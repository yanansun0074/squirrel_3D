3. Console output

- For Windows user: Editor Type >>> Python Console

- For MacOS user: few extra steps ðŸ™„ to follow from this tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbQCzk-ef3g

- I'm not sure about other operating systems

Before run "Scatter_Black", "Scatter_Cinnamon", and "Scatter_Gray", **be sure to create a sphere object with corresponding material in the viewport and select that object.** This is to take advantage of linked objects that save spaces, so that you won't find a 400 MB file when exportingðŸ˜¢.
